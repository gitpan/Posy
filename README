==== NAME ====

Posy - a website generator inspired by blosxom


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.71'' of Posy.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This is a simple website content management system inspired by the design of
blosxom. The filesystem is the database, there are flavour templates, and
plugins. However, this system doesn't require one to write one's entry files
in a particular format; one can choose from pure HTML, plain text, or
blosxom format. And other formats can be dealt with if one writes a plugin
to deal with them.

This distribution includes a CGI script (posy.cgi) and two command-line
scripts (posy_static, posy_one) which use the Posy engine to process input
data files into web-page output.

It also includes a number of plugins.


==   Terms   ==

A few terms:

data_dir, data directory
The directory where the input data files are kept. This need not be the same
directory as the posy.cgi script or any other script. This is set up with
sub-directories in a hierarchical fashion and chiefly contains the files
holding the web content you wish to display.

state_dir, state directory
The directory where "state" files are written. Thus this needs to be a
directory writable by the script, which may need special care when using
Posy with a CGI script, since the user and permissions tend to be tricky
with CGI scripts.

config_dir, config directory
The directory where configuration files are kept, in a hierarchical manner
which mirrors that of the data directory. This defaults to being the same
directory as the data_dir.

flavour_dir, flavour directory
The directory where flavour files are kept (see "flavour"), in a
hierarchical manner which mirrors that of the data directory.

full path, full filename
The absolute location of a given file; the absolute pathname.

path
(a) the relative location of a file (relative to the data directory or to
the top of the website, depending on context) (b) the current request path
(which may or may not be the relative location of a file)

path-type
The type of request path. This can be "entry", for an individual file,
"category", for a sub-directory, "chrono" for a dated request, "top_entry"
for an entry at the top of the website, "top_category", for the very root
page, or "file" for a file which is not an entry.

basename
The "base" name of a file. So a file called /wibbles.txt would have a
basename of "wibbles".

chunk
A given output page is pasted together from several chunks, each of which
has a "flavour" template for it. The chunks are:

content_type
The MIME-type of the output page. Usually this is text/html, but some
variations may call for text/plain or something else.

head
The "head" part of the page; which usually includes the opening <html> tag,
the <head> content, and the opening <body> tag and any initial content
required.

header
A header part of a page; something which may or may not be repeated over the
page, depending on how its contents change.

entry
The template for the actual page content; for pages which source multiple
entry-files per page, this is repeated for each entry file. An entry file is
just an individual input content file.

foot
The "foot" part of the page; usually contains trailing content, and the
closing </body> and </html> tags.

flavour
The Posy system, like the blosxom system, enables use of multiple
template-sets by giving them a "flavour" extension, which can be parsed from
the initial request path by either the extension of the request path, or by
a "flav" parameter. One can then set up a different template-set for each
flavour, and customize the look of the output pages while keeping the
content separate.


==== REQUIRES ====

    File::Spec
    File::stat

    File::Find
    Data::Dumper
    Storable
    CGI::Minimal

    Test::More


==== INSTALLATION ====

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
