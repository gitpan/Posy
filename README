==== NAME ====

Posy - a website generator inspired by blosxom


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.01'' of Posy.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This is a simple website content management system / blog inspired by the
design of blosxom. The filesystem is the database, there are flavour
templates, and plugins. However, this system doesn't require one to write
one's entry files in a particular format; one can choose from pure HTML,
plain text, or blosxom format. And other formats can be dealt with if one
writes a plugin to deal with them.


==== REQUIRES ====

    File::Spec
    File::stat
    FileHandle

    File::Find
    Data::Dumper
    Storable
    Carp
    CGI

    Test::More


==== INSTALLATION ====

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
