The current Posy distribution is set up as a standard Perl module
distribution, with modules under the "lib" directory, tests under
the "t" directory, Build.PL (this uses the Module::Build module
for building) MANIFEST, README, and so on.

In addition this contains:

- data directory, with test data and documentation files
- posy.cgi; a CGI script which uses the Posy.pm module
- posy_one; a script to generate one output file from one input file
  using just the default settings and flavours
- posy_static; a script to generate "static" pages from the same
  data as used by posy.cgi
