<h1>CONTROL FREAK: The Dating of the Death of Flight 503</h1>

<p>When exactly did the crash happen?</p>

<p>In the VR sequence when Sydney first takes Jarvis into VR, there is
a calendar on the desk. We don't see the whole of it, just "1990"
clearly, because his hand is in the way, but there is <em>one</em>
frame where we see the end of the month-name, and it is "EMBER". That
means it could be September, November, or December. However, the
calendar itself is actually not an accurate calendar for any of those
months, since it gives the first of the month as a Sunday, and the only
months in 1990 that started on a Sunday were April and July. September
and December in 1990 started on a Saturday, and November started on a
Thursday. Oh well, the props department fluffed it.</p>

<p>Going on further in the episode, what do I see? The report that
Oliver is looking at, entitled "Kyle Jarvis Investigation". It's pretty
blurry, and parts of it are obscured, but this is what I could make out
on the freeze-frame...</p>

<pre>
THIS FEDERAL REPORT SUGGESTS COCKPIT MORALE WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE
BELOW MENTIONED FliGHT.

This report makes official the findings resulting from the collision
of two... at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), flight
numbers 503 ... on September 13, 1990 at 14:03.  The controller ... in
this ... Jarvis at fault, having consumed alcohol previous to his
shift as controller... the code of traffic controllers ... 885B.  The
final fatality ... is 232.  The following pages list the facts and
c... which ... case numbered 1755 LAX (C).
</pre>

<p>So the crash occurred on September 13, 1990! That was a Thursday, if
anyone's interested.</p>

<p>And there were <em>two</em> planes involved, according to this! The
other flight doesn't get mentioned at all in the episode (and I
couldn't make out the flight number, it was too blurry). Maybe that was
part of the fiction. Or maybe the other flight got hit by some of the
debry.</p>

<p>Oh, it also seems that Oliver has <em>two</em> copies of this report
on his desk. One that he's looking at, and another which we see the
corner of, and it looks like the same report. How's that for
trivia?</p>

<h2>More obsessive detail about Control Freak</h2>

<p>I talked to a friend of mine (a guy I work with, he's got more than
twenty years experience in the airline industry) trying to figure out
what kind of an aircraft flight 503 could have be with the evidence of
the capacity, 232 fatalities, and the one aisle (rather than two) and
that it was in 1990.</p>

<p>If there were <em>two</em> aircraft involved then a couple of
737-300 series would fit - capacity of about 116 each.</p>

<p>If it was one aircraft, it might have been a 707 or a DC8, since
both have 200+ capacity and one aisle, and would have been used around
that era. It wouldn't be necessary that the aircraft was full to
capacity, after all. There could well have been other empty seats
besides Oliver's.</p>

<p>Also, it seems unlikely that 25D was a window seat in a large
aircraft. The way they number their seats, if 25D were a window seat,
then there would not be any rows wider than four across down the length
of the whole aircraft. This is because they number the seats so that
the same kind of seat gets the same kind of number, like so: If the
widest row in the aircraft is six seats wide (say, three on one side,
three on the other) then the seats in that row would be labelled
A-B-C-D-E-F. If the rows in first class only had four seats per row,
they would <em>not</em> be labelled A-B-C-D but rather A-B-E-F, missing
out the middle letters, not the end letters. That way, if one got 2F or
25F, you would have a window seat either way.</p>

<p>But of course that is such a fiddly detail that most people wouldn't
be aware of it. On the other hand, it could be that that airline got
the seats reconfigured in a non-standard way, but I don't see why they
would.</p>
