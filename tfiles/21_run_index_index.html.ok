<h3 id="howto">Plugins HOWTO</h3>

<pre>
Plugins HOWTO
=============

Plugins in Posy use the full power of object-oriented Perl.  Rather than
providing a rigid API where a plugin is only allowed to provide a
pre-defined set of methods, each plugin is a child (or grandchild, or
g-g-g-g-g-grandchild) of the Posy class.  Therefore, *any* method can
be overridden by a plugin.  This provides great power, but with great
power comes great responsibility -- in other words, be careful.

There are two things which determine the course of the Posy engine: the
list of plugins, and the list of actions.  Each is ordered, but each is
independent.  The order of the plugin list determines which methods will be
overridden; for any given method, the last plugin to implement that method
is the one whose version of that method will be used.

But plugins don't *have* to override existing methods; they can also
implement new ones.  That's where the list of actions comes in.  If
one wishes to insert a new action into the sequence of actions, then
one can make plugin with a new method which does this action, and
insert its name into the list of actions.

Where one is making a new method, one probably doesn't wish it to
be overridden, so in order to reduce the likelihood of it accidentally
(rather than deliberately) being overridden, try to give the method
a unique name.  Prefixing it with the name of the plugin is probably a good
idea.

So, for example, you make a "Dazzle" plugin, which does dazzling things
to the head of a page.  Instead of calling its head processing "head",
call it "dazzle_head".  And then add "dazzle_head" to the list of
actions after the "head" action.

Content
=======

The current Posy distribution is set up as a standard Perl module
distribution, with modules under the "lib" directory, tests under
the "t" directory, Build.PL (this uses the Module::Build module
for building) MANIFEST, README, and so on.

In addition this contains:

- data directory, with test data and documentation files
- posy.cgi; a CGI script which uses the Posy.pm module
- posy_one; a script to generate one output file from one input file
  using just the default settings and flavours
- posy_static; a script to generate "static" pages from the same
  data as used by posy.cgi

<h1>VR.5: The Wind of the Mind</h1>

<h2>Welcome To The Game</h2>

<p><em>Virtual Reality is real.</em> Really? No, not really. But once
upon a time, that was the tag-line of a most excellent TV show,
<strong><em>VR.5</em></strong>. It was hyped to the computer geek set,
and completely turned off the anal-retentive portion of same, because
of technical handwaving, such as the 300-baud acoustic modem through
which this VR was apparently piped.</p>

<p>But <em>VR.5</em> wasn't about Virtual Reality. It was about seeing
into the subconscious; the VR stuff was just the lever with which they
moved the world. Toss in recurring nightmares, angst, love, danger, and
a ruthless secret society, and you sort of get <em>Alfred
Hitchcock</em> meets <em>Dreamscape</em> (only better).</p>

<p>The original reason I watched VR.5 was because I was a fan of David
McCallum, (ever since I saw him as Steel in <em>Sapphire &amp;
Steel</em>) and I had heard he played the part of Sydney's dead father.
(see here for <a href="../events/runfywif.html">play review</a>)
I figured it couldn't be much of a part, seeing as he was dead, but I
watched it anyway. Boy, was I blown away!</p>

<p>And then Oliver Sampson came along... Played by Anthony Steward Head
(who then went on to play Rupert Giles in Buffy: The Vampire Slayer)
here was just the kind of character that I really like. Ambiguous,
dark, brooding, handsome (Englishman), <a href=
"../b7/avon_oliv.html">he reminds me of Kerr Avon...</a></p>

<p>To whet your appetite, here are selected <a href=
"../quotes/vr5quotes">quotes</a> from the series. They are in
Fortune format.</p>

<h2>It's Not What You Think</h2>

<p>Obsessive details about episodes of VR.5, thanks to a good
freeze-frame on my VCR. No point in looking at any of these unless
you've already seen the episodes in question - they won't mean anything
to you. First, <a href="mfile.html">the file</a> that Morgan sent to
Sydney in "Love and Death". Also, <a href="confr.html">extra
evidence</a> about the crash of flight 503 mentioned in "Control
Freak".</p>

<h3 id="mfile">Morgan's File</h3>

<h1>The File Morgan Sent in "Love and Death"</h1>

<p>In the VR.5 episode "Love and Death", Doctor Morgan found a
Committee file about Sydney's father, Dr. Bloom, and he told Sydney
that he had modemed it to her computer. When she went to look at it,
the file started vanishing before her eyes. This is all that she
managed to see.</p>

              DR. JOSEPH BLOOM

INTRODUCTION

    THIS CYBER HELIX RECOMBINATION DATA WAS COLLECTED BY DR. BLOOM
OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. HIS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH HAS GIVEN THE
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY A PLETHORA OF INFORMATION FORMALLY [sic.
'formerly'] UNKNOWN AND UNEXPLORED. DR. BLOOM LEADS HIS FIELD IN THIS
TYPE OF RESEARCH.  HIS CYBER HELIX RECOMBINATION WAS AN UNKNOWN
PHENOMENON UNTIL FIVE YEARS AGO AND NOW HIS HEADWAY IN THIS FIELD HAS
BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO THE SCIENCE OF RECOMBINATION WITHIN THE MODERN
WORLD.

    DUE TO HIS GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH, THE GAINS WITHIN THE VR
FIELD HAVE BEEN ADVANCING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS.  ALREADY THERE HAVE BEEN
DISCOVERIES WHICH HAVE ADDED TO AND AND VERIFIED THOSE OF DR. BLOOM.
THE TECHNOLOGY OF RESEARCH HAD ALSO BEEN ADVANCING WITH BREAKTHROUGHS
APPEARING ALL THE TIME.

I pieced together these paragraphs despite the fact that in some
frames Syd's hand was in the way, and in later frames, random words
were missing.]

<h1>CONTROL FREAK: The Dating of the Death of Flight 503</h1>

<p>When exactly did the crash happen?</p>

<p>In the VR sequence when Sydney first takes Jarvis into VR, there is
a calendar on the desk. We don't see the whole of it, just "1990"
clearly, because his hand is in the way, but there is <em>one</em>
frame where we see the end of the month-name, and it is "EMBER". That
means it could be September, November, or December. However, the
calendar itself is actually not an accurate calendar for any of those
months, since it gives the first of the month as a Sunday, and the only
months in 1990 that started on a Sunday were April and July. September
and December in 1990 started on a Saturday, and November started on a
Thursday. Oh well, the props department fluffed it.</p>

<p>Going on further in the episode, what do I see? The report that
Oliver is looking at, entitled "Kyle Jarvis Investigation". It's pretty
blurry, and parts of it are obscured, but this is what I could make out
on the freeze-frame...</p>

<pre>
THIS FEDERAL REPORT SUGGESTS COCKPIT MORALE WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE
BELOW MENTIONED FliGHT.

This report makes official the findings resulting from the collision
of two... at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), flight
numbers 503 ... on September 13, 1990 at 14:03.  The controller ... in
this ... Jarvis at fault, having consumed alcohol previous to his
shift as controller... the code of traffic controllers ... 885B.  The
final fatality ... is 232.  The following pages list the facts and
c... which ... case numbered 1755 LAX (C).
</pre>

<p>So the crash occurred on September 13, 1990! That was a Thursday, if
anyone's interested.</p>

<p>And there were <em>two</em> planes involved, according to this! The
other flight doesn't get mentioned at all in the episode (and I
couldn't make out the flight number, it was too blurry). Maybe that was
part of the fiction. Or maybe the other flight got hit by some of the
debry.</p>

<p>Oh, it also seems that Oliver has <em>two</em> copies of this report
on his desk. One that he's looking at, and another which we see the
corner of, and it looks like the same report. How's that for
trivia?</p>

<h2>More obsessive detail about Control Freak</h2>

<p>I talked to a friend of mine (a guy I work with, he's got more than
twenty years experience in the airline industry) trying to figure out
what kind of an aircraft flight 503 could have be with the evidence of
the capacity, 232 fatalities, and the one aisle (rather than two) and
that it was in 1990.</p>

<p>If there were <em>two</em> aircraft involved then a couple of
737-300 series would fit - capacity of about 116 each.</p>

<p>If it was one aircraft, it might have been a 707 or a DC8, since
both have 200+ capacity and one aisle, and would have been used around
that era. It wouldn't be necessary that the aircraft was full to
capacity, after all. There could well have been other empty seats
besides Oliver's.</p>

<p>Also, it seems unlikely that 25D was a window seat in a large
aircraft. The way they number their seats, if 25D were a window seat,
then there would not be any rows wider than four across down the length
of the whole aircraft. This is because they number the seats so that
the same kind of seat gets the same kind of number, like so: If the
widest row in the aircraft is six seats wide (say, three on one side,
three on the other) then the seats in that row would be labelled
A-B-C-D-E-F. If the rows in first class only had four seats per row,
they would <em>not</em> be labelled A-B-C-D but rather A-B-E-F, missing
out the middle letters, not the end letters. That way, if one got 2F or
25F, you would have a window seat either way.</p>

<p>But of course that is such a fiddly detail that most people wouldn't
be aware of it. On the other hand, it could be that that airline got
the seats reconfigured in a non-standard way, but I don't see why they
would.</p>

<p>KJA.</p>
