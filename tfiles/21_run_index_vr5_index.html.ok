<h1>VR.5: The Wind of the Mind</h1>

<h2>Welcome To The Game</h2>

<p><em>Virtual Reality is real.</em> Really? No, not really. But once
upon a time, that was the tag-line of a most excellent TV show,
<strong><em>VR.5</em></strong>. It was hyped to the computer geek set,
and completely turned off the anal-retentive portion of same, because
of technical handwaving, such as the 300-baud acoustic modem through
which this VR was apparently piped.</p>

<p>But <em>VR.5</em> wasn't about Virtual Reality. It was about seeing
into the subconscious; the VR stuff was just the lever with which they
moved the world. Toss in recurring nightmares, angst, love, danger, and
a ruthless secret society, and you sort of get <em>Alfred
Hitchcock</em> meets <em>Dreamscape</em> (only better).</p>

<p>The original reason I watched VR.5 was because I was a fan of David
McCallum, (ever since I saw him as Steel in <em>Sapphire &amp;
Steel</em>) and I had heard he played the part of Sydney's dead father.
(see here for <a href="../events/runfywif.html">play review</a>)
I figured it couldn't be much of a part, seeing as he was dead, but I
watched it anyway. Boy, was I blown away!</p>

<p>And then Oliver Sampson came along... Played by Anthony Steward Head
(who then went on to play Rupert Giles in Buffy: The Vampire Slayer)
here was just the kind of character that I really like. Ambiguous,
dark, brooding, handsome (Englishman), <a href=
"../b7/avon_oliv.html">he reminds me of Kerr Avon...</a></p>

<p>To whet your appetite, here are selected <a href=
"../quotes/vr5quotes">quotes</a> from the series. They are in
Fortune format.</p>

<h2>It's Not What You Think</h2>

<p>Obsessive details about episodes of VR.5, thanks to a good
freeze-frame on my VCR. No point in looking at any of these unless
you've already seen the episodes in question - they won't mean anything
to you. First, <a href="mfile.html">the file</a> that Morgan sent to
Sydney in "Love and Death". Also, <a href="confr.html">extra
evidence</a> about the crash of flight 503 mentioned in "Control
Freak".</p>
