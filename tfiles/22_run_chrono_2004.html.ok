<h3 id="howto">Plugins HOWTO</h3>

<pre>
Plugins HOWTO
=============

Plugins in Posy use the full power of object-oriented Perl.  Rather than
providing a rigid API where a plugin is only allowed to provide a
pre-defined set of methods, each plugin is a child (or grandchild, or
g-g-g-g-g-grandchild) of the Posy class.  Therefore, *any* method can
be overridden by a plugin.  This provides great power, but with great
power comes great responsibility -- in other words, be careful.

There are two things which determine the course of the Posy engine: the
list of plugins, and the list of actions.  Each is ordered, but each is
independent.  The order of the plugin list determines which methods will be
overridden; for any given method, the last plugin to implement that method
is the one whose version of that method will be used.

But plugins don't *have* to override existing methods; they can also
implement new ones.  That's where the list of actions comes in.  If
one wishes to insert a new action into the sequence of actions, then
one can make plugin with a new method which does this action, and
insert its name into the list of actions.

Where one is making a new method, one probably doesn't wish it to
be overridden, so in order to reduce the likelihood of it accidentally
(rather than deliberately) being overridden, try to give the method
a unique name.  Prefixing it with the name of the plugin is probably a good
idea.

So, for example, you make a "Dazzle" plugin, which does dazzling things
to the head of a page.  Instead of calling its head processing "head",
call it "dazzle_head".  And then add "dazzle_head" to the list of
actions after the "head" action.

Content
=======

The current Posy distribution is set up as a standard Perl module
distribution, with modules under the "lib" directory, tests under
the "t" directory, Build.PL (this uses the Module::Build module
for building) MANIFEST, README, and so on.

In addition this contains:

- data directory, with test data and documentation files
- posy.cgi; a CGI script which uses the Posy.pm module
- posy_one; a script to generate one output file from one input file
  using just the default settings and flavours
- posy_static; a script to generate "static" pages from the same
  data as used by posy.cgi

<h1>VR.5: The Wind of the Mind</h1>

<h2>Welcome To The Game</h2>

<p><em>Virtual Reality is real.</em> Really? No, not really. But once
upon a time, that was the tag-line of a most excellent TV show,
<strong><em>VR.5</em></strong>. It was hyped to the computer geek set,
and completely turned off the anal-retentive portion of same, because
of technical handwaving, such as the 300-baud acoustic modem through
which this VR was apparently piped.</p>

<p>But <em>VR.5</em> wasn't about Virtual Reality. It was about seeing
into the subconscious; the VR stuff was just the lever with which they
moved the world. Toss in recurring nightmares, angst, love, danger, and
a ruthless secret society, and you sort of get <em>Alfred
Hitchcock</em> meets <em>Dreamscape</em> (only better).</p>

<p>The original reason I watched VR.5 was because I was a fan of David
McCallum, (ever since I saw him as Steel in <em>Sapphire &amp;
Steel</em>) and I had heard he played the part of Sydney's dead father.
(see here for <a href="../events/runfywif.html">play review</a>)
I figured it couldn't be much of a part, seeing as he was dead, but I
watched it anyway. Boy, was I blown away!</p>

<p>And then Oliver Sampson came along... Played by Anthony Steward Head
(who then went on to play Rupert Giles in Buffy: The Vampire Slayer)
here was just the kind of character that I really like. Ambiguous,
dark, brooding, handsome (Englishman), <a href=
"../b7/avon_oliv.html">he reminds me of Kerr Avon...</a></p>

<p>To whet your appetite, here are selected <a href=
"../quotes/vr5quotes">quotes</a> from the series. They are in
Fortune format.</p>

<?php $out = `../cgi-bin/rand_text.cgi $(relTopDir)/quotes/vr5quotes`;
echo $out;
?>

<h2>It's Not What You Think</h2>

<p>Obsessive details about episodes of VR.5, thanks to a good
freeze-frame on my VCR. No point in looking at any of these unless
you've already seen the episodes in question - they won't mean anything
to you. First, <a href="mfile.html">the file</a> that Morgan sent to
Sydney in "Love and Death". Also, <a href="confr.html">extra
evidence</a> about the crash of flight 503 mentioned in "Control
Freak".</p>
