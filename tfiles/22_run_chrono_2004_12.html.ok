Plugins HOWTO
=============

Plugins in Posy use the full power of object-oriented Perl.  Rather than
providing a rigid API where a plugin is only allowed to provide a
pre-defined set of methods, each plugin is a child (or grandchild, or
g-g-g-g-g-grandchild) of the Posy class.  Therefore, *any* method can
be overridden by a plugin.  This provides great power, but with great
power comes great responsibility -- in other words, be careful.

There are two things which determine the course of the Posy engine: the
list of plugins, and the list of actions.  Each is ordered, but each is
independent.  The order of the plugin list determines which methods will be
overridden; for any given method, the last plugin to implement that method
is the one whose version of that method will be used.

But plugins don't *have* to override existing methods; they can also
implement new ones.  That's where the list of actions comes in.  If
one wishes to insert a new action into the sequence of actions, then
one can make plugin with a new method which does this action, and
insert its name into the list of actions.

Where one is making a new method, one probably doesn't wish it to
be overridden, so in order to reduce the likelihood of it accidentally
(rather than deliberately) being overridden, try to give the method
a unique name.  Prefixing it with the name of the plugin is probably a good
idea.

So, for example, you make a "Dazzle" plugin, which does dazzling things
to the head of a page.  Instead of calling its head processing "head",
call it "dazzle_head".  And then add "dazzle_head" to the list of
actions after the "head" action.

Content
=======

The current Posy distribution is set up as a standard Perl module
distribution, with modules under the "lib" directory, tests under
the "t" directory, Build.PL (this uses the Module::Build module
for building) MANIFEST, README, and so on.

In addition this contains:

- data directory, with test data and documentation files
- posy.cgi; a CGI script which uses the Posy.pm module
- posy_one; a script to generate one output file from one input file
  using just the default settings and flavours
- posy_static; a script to generate "static" pages from the same
  data as used by posy.cgi
