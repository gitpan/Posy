<h1>The File Morgan Sent in "Love and Death"</h1>

<p>In the VR.5 episode "Love and Death", Doctor Morgan found a
Committee file about Sydney's father, Dr. Bloom, and he told Sydney
that he had modemed it to her computer. When she went to look at it,
the file started vanishing before her eyes. This is all that she
managed to see.</p>

                 BY
              DR. JOSEPH BLOOM

INTRODUCTION

    THIS CYBER HELIX RECOMBINATION DATA WAS COLLECTED BY DR. BLOOM
OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. HIS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH HAS GIVEN THE
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY A PLETHORA OF INFORMATION FORMALLY [sic.
'formerly'] UNKNOWN AND UNEXPLORED. DR. BLOOM LEADS HIS FIELD IN THIS
TYPE OF RESEARCH.  HIS CYBER HELIX RECOMBINATION WAS AN UNKNOWN
PHENOMENON UNTIL FIVE YEARS AGO AND NOW HIS HEADWAY IN THIS FIELD HAS
BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO THE SCIENCE OF RECOMBINATION WITHIN THE MODERN
WORLD.

    DUE TO HIS GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH, THE GAINS WITHIN THE VR
FIELD HAVE BEEN ADVANCING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS.  ALREADY THERE HAVE BEEN
DISCOVERIES WHICH HAVE ADDED TO AND AND VERIFIED THOSE OF DR. BLOOM.
THE TECHNOLOGY OF RESEARCH HAD ALSO BEEN ADVANCING WITH BREAKTHROUGHS
APPEARING ALL THE TIME.
